I began building websites in CGI/Perl in 1995 and embraced Classic ASP in the late 90's to develop a proprietary CMS application for various TV and enterprise websites.

Along with my career-long coding & business partner, we purposely skipped DOTNET through the 90's and 00's -- until MVC came into the picture in 2009. We migrated to ASPNETCORE in the last 4 years and created WonderWomenCoders.com to teach women in our area.
